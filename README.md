# Katan Protocol

Katan Protocol looks to increase transparency, communications between protocols, and active user rewards. By scraping the AAVE interactions and using a Katan credit formulation, Katan uses Worldcoin's ZKP verification to create a soulbound credit score NFT.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run app (will open browser automatically).

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Go to [Usage instructions](#-usage-instructions).

## üóù Usage instructions

To test this dApp in the [Polygon Mumbai Testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com), follow these steps:

1. Prepare a wallet that has access to the Mumbai Testnet. We recommend using Metamask mobile (you will need to add the Mumbai network manually). Our [docs](https://id.worldcoin.org) contain more detailed instructions on how to do this. Alternatively, there's instructions for how to use the [WalletConnect Test Wallet](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-test-wallet).
2. Fund the wallet with some `MATIC`. You can use the [official faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology) or any other faucet.
3. Launch the mockWLD app (app that holds World ID identities and generates ZKPs) at: [https://mock-app.id.worldcoin.org](https://mock-app.id.worldcoin.org) & follow instructions to generate/fetch your identity and add it to the list of verified identities.

And you're good to go! The airdrop app will guide you through the process:

- You'll first connect your wallet (e.g. Metamask).
- You will then do the World ID verification process.
- You will then execute the smart contract transaction with your wallet.
